### Hi, I’m Farqil! 👋
Actually my name is Farrel, because my name is "pasaran" so I decided to combine my first name "Farrel" with my middle name "Aqilla" and VOILA it's become Farqil.

As an Informatics Engineering student, I spend most of my days wrestling with code like it's a wild animal I'm trying to tame. My brain is constantly doing gymnastics, flipping between "Wait, what does this error mean?" and "Oh, I fixed it! Wait... never mind." But despite the endless bugs and late-night debugging marathons, I actually enjoy this madness. There's something weirdly satisfying about turning coffee into code. I may struggle now, but I'm determined to transform from a code-clumsy newbie into a programming ninja-one keystroke at a time!

- 👀 I’m interested in data security
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit of programming languages
- ⚡ Fun fact: Drinks coffee still make me sleepy
